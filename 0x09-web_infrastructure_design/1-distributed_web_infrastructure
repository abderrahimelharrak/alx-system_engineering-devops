Explanation:

The user's computer initiates a request to access www.foobar.com.
DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the Load Balancer (LB).
The Load Balancer distributes traffic between Server 1 (Web Server) and Server 2 (Application Server) using the Round Robin algorithm.
Server 1 handles static content and forwards dynamic content to Server 2.
Server 2 executes the application code and communicates with the MySQL Database Cluster.
The Database Cluster consists of a Primary Node (handles write operations) and Replica Nodes (handle readÂ operations).
