Explanation:

The user's computer initiates a request to access www.foobar.com.
DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the Load Balancer (LB).
The Load Balancer distributes traffic between Server 1 and Server 2.
Server 1 and Server 2 host both web and application servers (Nginx).
The Load Balancer terminates SSL and uses an SSL certificate for encrypted traffic.
Firewalls 1, 2, and 3 are placed at various points to control and secure network traffic.
The Database Server (MySQL) is secured and monitored for optimal performance.
Monitoring clients on each server collect performance metrics and send data to the monitoring service.
This design illustrates a more secure and monitored infrastructure with firewalls, SSL encryption, and monitoring components. Remember that this is a simplified representation, and in a real-world scenario, additional details and considerations would be necessary.
