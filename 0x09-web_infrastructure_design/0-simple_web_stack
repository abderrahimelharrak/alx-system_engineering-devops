Explanation:

The user's computer initiates a request to access www.foobar.com.
The DNS server resolves www.foobar.com to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
The user's request reaches the server, which hosts both the web server (Nginx) and the application server.
Nginx handles static content and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
The application server executes the application code and interacts with the MySQL database.
The response travels back through the web server to the user's computer.
Remember, this is a simplified schema, and in a real-world scenario, you would also need to consider security measures, backup strategies, and potentially load balancing for better scalability and redundancy.
